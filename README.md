# Basic-Social-Media-Website
Very, very basic social media website


// Original Plans for the site

A website that highlights people’s achievements, allow those to be shared with jobs

link that looks like

orlandop.websitename.net

works with GitHub, pictures, scholly, anything that helps you highlight your greatest achievements

Target audience would be people who are in search for jobs or people who would like to track progress

I think of it to be like a trophy room, but instead of only achievements showing the progress as well. You write updates as you go and once you get to the accomplishment it can be like a thread.

Different like (sub) threads for different goals, and

Should this be a social media type or a personal help type?

no goals have to be public/ it can be used as an application to help you track progress but not have to show it to others

Phone app as well because you may want to write something down or track something without wanting to go to a computer/ I think websites like these would not be accessed through safari on iPhone like…

username pw obv, social like adding people

each post has individual link, to make it easy to share, or the sharing would just be like an image of the post and a link to profile 

Timeline? Or “latest achievements” page

I want a quirky name so you can say “damn look at this dudes new (tweet) or goalie”

damn goalkeeper is a good name

"Just posted a goalie" WHAAAAAAAA

No goalkeeper domain names available
Rip

Mygoalie is open


i want people to be able to be able to show for themselves 



people who are wokring for same goals can come to eachother and give tips to eachother with search 

easy remembering, : you forgot what you meal prepped this one month and you can go back to it and find recipe, what and how you cooked it
